## Is It Legal? 🤔  

Honestly... idk, haven’t read the site’s Terms of Service. 😅  
Considering the site hasn’t been updated in ~1.5 years, I doubt the devs care.  
Use at your own risk! 🚨

## Bug Fixes & Contributions 🛠️  

I work on these plugins in my free time, so I probably won’t have time to fix any bugs you find. 😬  
- **Found a Bug?** Create an Issue!

## My Ideas 🚀  

- [ ] **Game Stats Menu** 📊  
  - Save game history, store data in cookies/storage.  
  - Display total games played, average score, records by category, and score trends (e.g., graphs for the last X games).  

- [ ] **Avatar Picker** 🖼️  
  - Experienced players may notice that your avatar is tied to your username. Likely, there’s a hashing algorithm at play.  
  - Build a tool to explore and preview avatar options based on nicknames.  

- [ ] **AI Opponent** 🤖  
  - Not a browser plugin but a bot powered by neural networks (e.g., ResNet/Yolo).  
  - I started researching it in this repo: [Lostgamer-AI](https://github.com/wilfordaf/Lostgamer-AI), but never finished.

Happy gaming! 🎮
