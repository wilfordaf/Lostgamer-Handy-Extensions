## Example Gameplay Flow 🔄  

Here’s how I use the plugin for fast-paced gameplay:  

1. Go to the game page and select a mode (this page has the "Start Game" button).  
2. Press **`1`** to start the game.  
3. Pick a location on the map, then press **`Space`** for "Make Guess."  
4. Press **`1`** to move to the next round.  
5. If the game isn’t going well, press **`Mouse Button 5`** to return to the previous page (the game window) – this is a browser hotkey.  
6. Repeat as needed.  

This setup eliminates unnecessary clicks, helps you play faster, and keeps you focused on setting records! 🏆

## Limitations ⚠️  

- In the "Next Round" menu, pressing **`Space`** will instantly make a guess in the next round. Avoid this!  
- You can only reassign hotkeys directly in the plugin code. 🛠️ **Pro Tip**: Use ChatGPT for help! 🤓

Enjoy the streamlined gameplay! 🎯
